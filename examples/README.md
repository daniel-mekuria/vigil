# StatLite examples

Starter configurations and runnable demo apps for monitoring applications with
StatLite. See [Configuration](../docs/configuration.md) for the full settings
reference and [StatLite Metrics v1](../docs/statlite-metrics-v1.md) for the
fixed JSON endpoint profile.

## Config files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `actuator.yaml` | Single Spring Boot Actuator target with Basic Auth placeholders |
| `statlite.yaml` | Monitor another StatLite instance via `statlite-metrics` |
| `multi-target.yaml` | Mixed targets: Actuator, StatLite Metrics, and self-monitoring |

Run a config from the repository root, for example:

```bash
go run ./cmd/statlite --config examples/actuator.yaml
```

## Demo apps
